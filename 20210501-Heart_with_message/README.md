# Heart with message

This is a model of a heart with a low level relief text. Very nice for a gift
for someone you love. Made in OpenSCAD, just need to set some initial variables
at the beginning of the file to set the text.

Text is set in two variables for names that goes on each side of a small heart
at the message.
